## ðŸš€ React part 1: Routing deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Bundled using Vite** - Set up the project using Vite for efficient development and bundling. Created vite.config.js with React plugin and development server configuration.

- [x] **Components** - Created several React components:
  - Navigation.jsx - Handles the navigation bar and login state
  - Home.jsx - Displays the welcome page and zoo entrance
  - About.jsx - Shows information about the application
  - Animals.jsx - Displays the list of animals in a table
  - Login.jsx - Handles user authentication
  - Manage.jsx - Provides interface for adding/removing animals

  - Created routes in App.jsx for all pages (/home, /about, /animals, /manage, /login)
  - Used Link components in Navigation for smooth client-side navigation
  - Protected routes based on login state
  - Implemented proper navigation after login/logout

## ðŸš€ React part 2: Reactivity deliverable

- [x] **Component communication** - Implemented:
  - Context (ZooContext) for managing animal data

## ðŸš€ Service Deliverable

For this deliverable, I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Node.js/Express HTTP service** - Created a Node.js/Express service with endpoints for user registration, login, and animal facts. The server is set up in `service/index.js` and includes a test endpoint to verify server functionality.
- [x] **Static middleware for frontend** - Set up Express static middleware to serve the React frontend, ensuring seamless integration between the backend and frontend.
- [x] **Calls to third-party service endpoints** - Implemented a simulated animal facts API endpoint in `src/about/about.jsx` to fetch random animal facts.
- [x] **Backend service endpoints** - Created endpoints for user registration (`/api/register`), login (`/api/login`), and animal management (`/api/animals`). These endpoints are defined in `service/index.js` and `service/routes/animals.js`.
- [x] **Frontend calls service endpoints** - Updated React components in `src/context/ZooContext.jsx`, `src/login/login.jsx`, and `src/register/Register.jsx` to call the backend service endpoints for fetching, adding, and removing animals, as well as user authentication.

## ðŸš€ DB/Login deliverable

For this deliverable I implemented user authentication and MongoDB integration:

- [x] **User registration** - Created a registration form with validation in `src/auth/Auth.jsx` that allows users to create accounts. The backend endpoint in `service/auth.js` handles user creation in MongoDB with secure password hashing via bcrypt.

- [x] **User login and logout** - Built login functionality with JWT token authentication. The login form in `src/auth/Auth.jsx` authenticates users against the database. Authentication state is maintained using localStorage and a custom `AuthContext` that provides login state across the application. Logout functionality clears credentials from storage.

- [x] **Stores data in MongoDB** - Connected to MongoDB using Mongoose. Created schemas for Users (`service/User.js`) and Zoo animals (`service/Animal.js`). All animal data is now persistently stored in MongoDB collections.

- [x] **Stores credentials in MongoDB** - User credentials are securely stored in MongoDB with passwords encrypted using bcrypt. The User schema in `service/User.js` includes a pre-save hook that automatically hashes passwords before storing them.

- [x] **Restricts functionality based on authentication** - Added protected routes in `src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx` that require authentication. Zoo management (`/manage`) and animal viewing (`/animals`) are now restricted to logged-in users only. The authentication is enforced both on the frontend and backend using JWT verification middleware.

### Technical Implementation Details

- Used Mongoose for MongoDB object modeling
- Implemented JWT for stateless authentication
- Created middleware for route protection on the backend
- Built a context-based authentication system on the frontend
- Added proper error handling for authentication failures
- Implemented secure password storage with bcrypt hashing

## ðŸš€ WebSocket deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Backend listens for WebSocket connection** - Created a WebSocket server in `service/index.js` that listens for connections from the frontend.
- [x] **Frontend makes WebSocket connection** - Implemented a WebSocket client in `src/context/WebSocketContext.jsx` that connects to the server.
- [x] **Data sent over WebSocket connection** - Set up real-time animal activity notifications using WebSockets. When a user adds or removes an animal, this information is broadcast to all connected clients.
- [x] **WebSocket data displayed** - Added a notification component that displays real-time updates about animal additions and removals from other users.
- [x] **Application is fully functional** - The application now includes all required features: MongoDB storage, user authentication, and real-time WebSocket notifications.
